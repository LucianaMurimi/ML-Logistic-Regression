# logistic-regression-example
Logistic regression is illustrated using PIMA Indian diabetes data set. Based on the data, either a diabetic or non-diabetic outcome can be predicted. 

## Objectives: 
1.	To perform data visualization on the dataset.
2.	To build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

## Pima Indians Diabetes Database
Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures

## Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database, also in the repository as diabetes.csv
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. 
The independent variables include: 
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

`Jupyter notebook` was used for this project. The file named `Logistic regression _ PIMA data set` contains the code and its explanations as the task is done to meet the above objectives.
